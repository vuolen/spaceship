# spaceship

This is my small ClojureScript+Reagent test project
You can test it [here](https://vuolen.github.io/spaceship/index.html), the spaceships should follow your mouse.

The spaceships are actual divs and all movement is done with CSS, so performance might be horrid on low end devices. It was just a fun idea not to use a canvas but oh well.
